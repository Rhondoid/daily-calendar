# daily-calendar

## Description

This is a workday calendar to add events by hour for the current day.

I need to be able to keep track of daily tasks and see at a glance which are past, present, and future using color coding
I learned to write blocks of code to make a type of form document.


## Usage

Simply add text to the open text area that you wish to keep track of.
